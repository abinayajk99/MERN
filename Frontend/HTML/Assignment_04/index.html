        <p class="font-[Poppins] text-[16px] text-white">A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods. 
        Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while French-born Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile in 1808. 
        The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in 1886, when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. 
        Commercial cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars that was accessible and affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. 
        Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages. </p>
